// There are four basic steps involved in building a test:

// Creating the structure (just creating a class that inherits from \Drupal\Tests\BrowserTestBase or a similar browser test class)
// Initializing the test case with whatever user creation or configuration needs to be done
// Creating actual tests within the test case
// And, of course, trying desperately to figure out why our test doesn't work the way we expect, and debugging the test (and perhaps the module)

//To start, we just need a bit of boilerplate extending BrowserTestBase.
